<h1 class="post-title entry-title">What is Prolog?</h1>
		
<p>A. is an opening to a story that establishes the context and gives background details, often some earlier story that ties into the main one.</p>
<p><strong>OR</strong></p>
<p>B. is a high-level computer programming language first devised for artificial intelligence applications.</p>
<p>Of course its B. But, what <strong>REALLY IS</strong> Prolog?</p>
<p>There are different approaches to <a href="http://www.repoftherockies.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">software&nbsp;development</a>&nbsp;other than using a traditional language. Other types of useful languages exist, such as Prolog. Prolog is a logic programming language from the 1970s that is still one of the main programming languages used in artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. Prolog is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Turing complete</a> and uses logic to answer complex questions.</p>
<p>A popular implementation of Prolog is <a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">SWI-Prolog</a>. SWI-Prolog is an open-source, free version of Prolog that you can even try online. Some developers use SWI-Prolog to develop web applications. Check out <a href="http://www.pathwayslms.com/swipltuts/html/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">this tutorial</a>&nbsp;to see how web development is possible with SWI-Prolog.</p>
